## About this project
![screenshot of project](/everything-screenshot.jpg)

This project was created as a team week project to mark the end of our Epicodus Intermediate JavaScript module. We created a simple game based on The Price Is Right, inviting the player to guess the price of Amazon items. Inspiration for this project came from Tom Watson's [Wikitrivia](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/). 

Visit the [Live Site](https://lionturtle99.github.io/Bob_Barker/) to play the game for yourself.

## Get Started

###### The ```$``` indicates it's written in your command line.

- Ensure that you have installed the latest versions of Git ([instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)) and Node.js ([instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
- In your command line, clone this repository using ```$ git clone https://github.com/lionturtle99/Bob_Barker.git```
- Navigate to the project directory, then install the reqired project dependencies with ```$ npm install```.
- This project requires a [Rainforest API](https://www.rainforestapi.com/) key to get item data. This key must be stored in the following format ```API_KEY = {your_key_goes_here}``` in a file called `.env` stored in the project's root directory. If an API key is not stored in exactly this format, name, and location, the project will not function correctly.
- To build and view the project in your default browser, use the command ```$ npm run start``` to deploy a webpack development server. Please note that Google Chrome may be required to use all features.
